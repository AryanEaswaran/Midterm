<p>It doesn't take a lot to make music today. A sound card, an instrument and a restless mind are all one needs. Every musician, struggling or professional, knows that nothing music related comes cheap. So here's the Bakers Dozen under $500 "budget" production set up.
    <p></p>
<br>
        First, you're going to need the right kind of software. Before deciding what software to buy, think about what kind of music you want to make and what you plan on doing with what you make. Save the hate for Garageband (free), because that's all you'll use when you start out. If you've got the money however, Logic Pro, Ableton or Pro Tools?
<p></p>
<br>
I've used Logic  ($200) for three years now. The interface is simple and intuitive even though the features are incredibly advanced. It has a plethora of software patches and synths that can be modified endlessly. It's simple to add plug-ins and the app has never crashed on me (13inch Macbook pro 2014 and 13inch Macbook Pro 2017). However, it is exclusive to apple devices. 
<p></p>
<br>
Ableton (currently discounted at $149) is a great option if your music uses a lot of sampling. The sampling tool in Ableton is the best. There, I've said it. Quantization works more intuitively on Ableton too. However, the interface can be a bit overwhelming for newbies.  
<p></p>
<br>
Pro Tools is industry grade, but its cost ($2,499) puts it well out of our "budget". Apart from these three, there is the windows exclusive option of Fruit Loops. The Producers edition (Their "Fruity" edition is too limited) costs $199. Fruit Loops is popular among electronic music artists. Its sampler is simple to use, its interface is tidy with less clutter around the Digital Audio Workstation and its sound manipulation presets are ideal for someone getting into electronic music. 
<p></p>
<br>
Reaper is an amazing free option. It has a plethora of professional tools. The main drawback is the interface. Its terrible. Its tough to find simple things and it requires an understanding of a lot of sonic aspects of sound to properly utilize its professional features. It also has no in-built patches so you have to use plug-ins or design your own. Having used it purely for mastering my songs, I will say it is worth the time spent learning it. You can really fine tune your sound with reaper. 
<p></p>
<br>
Next, you're going to want to get an input interface. Do not cheap out here. This is what determines the quality of the sound recorded. I have been using an Apogee JAM for the past 4 years (upgraded to the 96K Apogee jam a couple of months back). For $99 on Amazon this device is perfect for single instrument recording. It features a single input and single output that connects to your computer via USB. It features a gain nob. I have experienced zero sync delay in my time using the Apogee JAM. The in-built noise gate is OK, but I rely more on the software noise-gate personally. 
<p></p>
<br>
If you play the electric guitar or keyboard the setup process is fairly simple. You connect the guitar or keyboard to the JAM and then the JAM to your laptop. Select the JAM as the input device on the software you choose to use, and you're good to go. If you're using an acoustic instrument or are recording vocals you're going to need a mic. If you don't have a guitar with you now, I recommend buying a budget or beginner guitar to start of with. You can edit the sound to make it sound good. You can also pick up a decent MIDI keyboard for 
<p></p>
<br>
There are too many mics to choose from. Having a budget actually makes your decision easier. On a budget, focus on getting a mic you are comfortable with, rather than one tailored to a particular purpose (like a ribbon mic for drums or a Bi-Cardioid ) is key. You can either get a USB mic or a standard mic that you can connect using the JAM. The Audio2000s ADM1064B ($12.96) is what I use. Its surprisingly great for its price and comes in a hard shell carry case too. It has a great dynamic range and a wide sound capture field. However, it can sound hot (a state of high gain and jarring sharpness in recorded audio) even when input gain is increased by even 30 percent. If you're not about complicated mic set ups, get a USB mic. Its as simple as connecting it to your laptop. The Blue Yeti ($115) is extremely popular among podcasters and independent musicians for its clarity and natural warm tone. 
<p></p>
<br>
An important part of making music, is listening to it. You need a decent set of headphones. Ideally reference headphones are the best, since they output exactly what is inputted without any filters but reference headphones are oh so expensive. There are very few budget options for good headphones, so rather than recommending a pair, I recommend a price range. Anything between $50 to $100. But whatever headphones you decide to get, learn its sound signature inside out. Know exactly what your headphones sound like and how they treat sound. Avoid headphones that have Extra Bass or other filters. 
<p></p>
<br>
There you have it, everything you need to make music in under $500. Any of the set-ups suggested here are also extremely portable if you are using a laptop. The JAM, the mic and the cables easily fit in a bag pack while you can carry your instrument in your hand. I use my Ibanez JS100, the Apogee JAM and the ADM1064B to make music in my dorm room. However low the budget, if you spend right, your music  will be a lot bigger than the room you make it in.
